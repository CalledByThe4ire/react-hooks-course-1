## What is this project?

Example project using [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), as taught by Reed Barger's ["React Hooks" Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/react-hooks/).

Built during the first Off-sprint Day of [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), giving Software Engineers dedicated time to learn, hack and experiment. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Sample Apps

### React Hooks Intro

See `Login.js` and `Register.js` to see how you might handle state and form submission using hooks.

### Hooks News
